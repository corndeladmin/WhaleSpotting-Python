## Flask-User templates

The Flask-User library comes with its own templates for certain pages such as login, register and many more.

If we want to override those templates - e.g. to add our own nav bar - we need to do so in this folder, following the instructions outlined in the [Flask-User docs](https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unused.html#form-templates).
